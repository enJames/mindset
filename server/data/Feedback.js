    feedback_25_32: "You're not too sure whether or not you can change your skills and intelligence. Your grades and performances are important to you and so is learning. You're not the biggest fan of putting in too much effort though.",
    feedback_33_40: "You believe that you can develop your skills and intelligence. You really care about learning and don't mind having to put in some effort to make it happen. Performing well matters to you but you think that learning is actually more important than always scoring well and looking good.",
    feedback_41_48: "You totally believe that you can grow and improve your skills and intelligence. You love challenges and know that the best way to learn is by working really hard. You don't mind making mistakes or looking bad in order to get better."
